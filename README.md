# Turtle Race

This is a simple game built with Python on top of the Turtle module. The game is actually a race between 5 turtles!

## How it works

The game is a race between 5 turtles, and one of these turtles is yours, which you choose before the race begins. The turtles move forward in random increments, and the first one to reach the finish line is the winner.

**The goal is to win this completely random race.**

## More About this project

This project was built to practice Python in a real-world scenario by creating an intermediate-level game. The main idea for this project came from one of the projects/challenges in my [Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).
